### How did this happen?
This is an easy one to explain. First off, the chorus is pretty damn catchy. Especially the part about "Ring the bells". That's where my puppy comes in. We're in the process of potty training him and we use these things called "Potty Bells". You hang them near the door and when the dog needs to go outside, the dog does pretty much whatever he can to ring the bells. Usually he runs into them with his nose. So when I go to take him outside, he has to ring the bells before I open the door. "Ring the bells! Ring the bells! Who's a good boy? You are!" Over and over. Every time I do this I get this song stuck in my head. Makes sense, right?

When I was younger and they played this a lot on the radio/MTV, I used to also get the "People, people" line lodged in my brain, too. Still do. "People, people...ring the bells!" This repeats over and over. All in all, not a bad song to become an earworm for thirty years.

### So about the song...
Robbie Robertson was a mystery to me when this song came out in 1987. I was not familiar with his work in his most famous band, The Band.
