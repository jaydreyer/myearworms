### How did this happen?
When I get tired of a song on XM, usually First Wave, I'll hit my other favs including XMU, and Lithium. Lithium is all 90s grunge so it's a steady diet of Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and Stone Temple Pilots. When they play "Sour Girl", it usually rattles around in my head for a while. This is exactly what happened.

### Go ahead. Let's hear it.
Oh boy. Here it is in its 90s MTV glory:

### So about the song...
Wait. We'll talk about the song after we discuss the video. We have Scott Weiland doing his shirtless dance (he was in good shape!). We have what can only be described as "evil Teletubbies". We also have the lovely and talented Sarah Michelle Gellar, who was, I guess, a big fan of STP. See, you learn something new here all of the time.

"Sour Girl" was a track from STP's 2000 release *{{< amazon-link B000021XR5 "No. 4" >}}* and it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album. They recorded *No. 4* after they took a break due to some, umm, *issues* caused by Weiland's drug usage. When they got back together to record they decided to go back to a pretty heavy (for them) sound. "Sour Girl" is not heavy.

It is a catchy tune, though, and I've always kind of liked it. So it's not the worst thing to have stuck in your brain. The harmonies are nice and I like the overall vibe of the track. I don't seek it out, but I won't change the station if it's playing.

Evidently the song is about his first wife who used to be happy but, for whatever reason, got sick of Weiland's crap. Go figure! "She was a happy girl the day that she left me." The line "I pay a ransom note to stop it from steaming" is about how much the divorce was costing him. If you ever want to be depressed you can search out stuff on Weiland's life. What a mess.
